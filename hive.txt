fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile tblproperties ("skip.head.line.count"="1");



4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 



load data inpath '/data1/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales;

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"


create table sales_orc
(
ordernumber bigint,
quantityorder int,
price_each float,
order_line_number int,
sales float,
status string,

)
stored as orc;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


 insert into sales_orc select * from sales;


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year

select year_id, sum(sales) as total_sales_per_year from sales_orc group by year_id;


b) Find a product for which maximum orders were placed.


select product_line,count(quantityorder) as max_order from sales_orc group by product_line having count(quantityorder)>1 order by max_order desc limit 1;

Classic Cars	33992

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter


select qtr_id,sum(sales) as qtr_sale from sales_orc group by qtr_id;



d. In which quarter sales was minimum


select qtr_id,sum(sales) as qtr_sale from sales_orc group by qtr_id order by qtr_sale desc limit 1;



e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum


with new_table as (select country, sum(sales) as c_sales from sales_orc group by country) select country , c_sales from new_table order by c_sales desc limit 1 union all select country , c_sales from new_table order by c_sales asc limit 1;




f) calculate quarterly sales for each city


select city,qtr_id,sum(sales) as qc_sales from sales_orc group by qtr_id , city ;



h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold

select year_id,month_id,total_order from (select *,
rank()over (partition by year_id order by total_order desc) rankk from(select year_id,month_id,sum(quantityorder) as total_order from sales_orc group by year_id, month_id order by year_id, month_id  ) a)b where rankk=1;
